	<h3>Self assembly of soft polymer spheres</h3>
<p>
  I worked from summer 2016 until fall 2017 under Professor Greg Grason on a geomtric model for the assembly of squishy polymer spheres into lattice structures based on energy minimization. The paper from this research is in the process of being published.
